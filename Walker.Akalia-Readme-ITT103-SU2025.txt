 1.The purpose of the program is to-

Add and manage patient and doctor records in the Hospital System, 
Book and cancel Appointments,
View Doctor schedules and patient & doctor profiles
Generate bills after scheduled appointment
Validate user's input (catch errors)


2. How to run it-
Use PyCharm and open the terminal or command prompt,
Navigate to the folder containing the HSM.py file,
Run the file using the command "run"
After a console menu for the HSM will appear do what it says.

Required modifications-
Use file handling or a database for persistent storage so data isnâ€™t lost when the program closes causing it to have to be done again,
Create a graphical interface or a web interface,
Add authentication/password entry for staff and patients to model a real world system security, and have the users login.


 4. Any assumptions or limitations regarding its operation-
All records are stored in memory during runtime. Exiting the program clears all data that was entered and data will be lost,
There is a single user role as the current version assumes one administrative user; no roles like "doctor" or "patient" login exist in this program,
Users must enter valid formats for names, dates, and other options. Exception handling manages basic errors, but not advanced formatting issues,
Every input is manual and it's a long system so every detail of an Hospital System can't be included.
